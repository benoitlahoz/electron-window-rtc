Inspired by [electron-peer-connection](https://github.com/han-gyeol/electron-peer-connection), `electron-window-rtc` is a zero-dependency package that allows sharing medias between [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) windows through [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) with (almost) zero-latency, depending on application configuration.

It works by creating a **main process** events hub that acts as a signaling server for the windows through Electron's IPC. Once windows are registered, each **renderer process** creates a `WindowRTCPeerConnection` to another window and begins to send/receive media streams.

This package was primarily released to handle video/canvas manipulation before sending it to a [window rendered offscreen](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/offscreen-rendering) passed to the [Syphon framework](https://github.com/Syphon/Syphon-Framework) with same author's [node-syphon](https://github.com/benoitlahoz/node-syphon) package.

## Install

```sh
npm i -s electron-window-rtc
```

```sh
yarn add electron-window-rtc
```

## Usage

See [Electron+Vue example](https://github.com/benoitlahoz/electron-window-rtc/tree/main/example) for a complete integration example.

### Main process

```typescript
// WindowRTCMain is a singleton.
import { WindowRTCMain } from 'electron-window-rtc';

const senderWindow: BrowserWindow = createWindow(); // Left to application.
const receiverWindow: BrowserWindow = createWindow();

// Note that windows can both send and receive by creating two connection (see below in 'renderer process' section).

WindowRTCMain.register('sender', senderWindow);
WindowRTCMain.register('receiver', receiverWindow);
```

### Renderer process

#### Sender

```typescript
import {
  WindowRTCPeerConnection,
  defineIpc,
} from 'electron-window-rtc/renderer';

// Important: define early how to access to IPC object, according to application 'preload' script.
// The IPC object must at least expose `on`, `removeListener`, `send` and `invoke` methods (see IPCObject below).
defineIpc(window.electron.ipcRenderer);

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) => {
  const windowConnection = new WindowRTCPeerConnection('receiver');

  // Canvas for example...
  const canvas: HTMLCanvasElement = document.getElementById('canvas');

  // Add track from canvas: this will create an 'offer' for 'receiver' window.
  // Note the '240' fps framerate: leaving it empty creates latency in the receiver.
  windowConnection.addStream(canvas.captureStream(240));
});
```

#### Receiver

```typescript
import {
  WindowRTCPeerConnection,
  defineIpc,
} from 'electron-window-rtc/renderer';

// Important: define early how to access to IPC object, according to application 'preload' script.
// The IPC object must at least expose `on`, `removeListener`, `send` and `invoke` methods (see IPCObject below).
defineIpc(window.electron.ipcRenderer);

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) => {
  const windowConnection = new WindowRTCPeerConnection('sender');

  // Listen to 'track' added by 'sender' window.
  windowConnection.on('track', (event: EventManagerDTO) => {
    const video: HTMLVideoElement = document.getElementById('video');

    const trackEvent: RTCTrackEvent = event.payload;
    const streams = trackEvent.streams;
    for (const stream of streams) {
      // For the sake of this example, keep only one stream, we could also get `streams[0]`.
      video.srcObject = null;
      video.srcObject = stream;
    }
  });
});
```

### Types

#### IpcObject

Describes the IPC object used by `electron-window-rtc`

```typescript
interface IpcObject {
  on: (
    channel: string,
    callback: (event: IpcRendererEvent, ...args: any[]) => void
  ) => void;
  removeListener: (
    channel: string,
    callback: (event: IpcRendererEvent, ...args: any[]) => void
  ) => void;
  send: (channel: string, ...args: any[]) => void;
  invoke: (channel: string, ...args: any[]) => Promise<any>;
}
```

#### WindowRTCEvent

Describes the generic event data sent and received by `WindowRTCPeerConnection`.

**WARNING:** interface name and property keys may change. The reason is that, for internal events, `sender` and `receiver` do not correspond to the actual event. For example, in case of `iceconnectionstatechange` event, the `sender` is actually the local peer receiving the event (self) and receiver is the remote one (`peer`) that is actually not receiving anything.

```typescript
interface WindowRTCEvent {
  sender: string;
  receiver: string;
  payload: any;
}

// Example.
windowConnection.on('track', (event: WindowRTCEvent) => {
  const sender: string = event.sender;
  const receiver: string = event.receiver;
  const trackEvent: RTCTrackEvent = event.payload;
});
```

## Using `canvas`

When using `canvas` to get an image to send to other windows, application should set the `frameRequestRate` parameter of `canvas.captureStream` to a high framerate to avoid latency at the receiver side.

### Setting `frameRequestRate`

![alt good_performance](https://github.com/benoitlahoz/electron-window-rtc/blob/main/assets/electron-demo-240fps.jpg)

**Fig. 1:** _`const stream = canvas.captureStream(240);` in `Sender` window doesn't induce latency. Look at the result of `performance.now()` sent by the `Sender`._

### Withour setting `frameRequestRate`

![alt bad_performance](https://github.com/benoitlahoz/electron-window-rtc/blob/main/assets/electron-demo.jpg)

**Fig. 2:** _Without setting `frameRequestRate`: a latency of ~30ms is induced._

## Known Issues

- In the Electron example provided, reloading `Sender` window takes a lot of time for `Receiver` window to reconnect, whereas the `requestOffer` method allows reconnecting quickly on `Receiver` window's reload.
- Closing and opening again windows has not been tested: it may involve some logic in the `main process` to be integrated in `WindowRTCMain`.
